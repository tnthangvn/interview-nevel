## Check list
Please review the following items and proceed with coding:

- Ensure responsive designs are tested across PC, tablet, and smartphone screen widths.
- Confirm that next build completes successfully.
- Ensure that files are placed according to guidelines and that naming is easily understandable by anyone.
- (Especially in styling) Avoid using magic numbers; make sure the code clearly indicates what colors and numbers represent, so that it is readable by a third party.
